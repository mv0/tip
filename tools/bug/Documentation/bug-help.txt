bug-help(1)
============

NAME
----
bug-help - display help information about bug

SYNOPSIS
--------
'bug help' [-a|--all] [COMMAND]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

With no options and no COMMAND given, the synopsis of the 'bug'
command and a list of the most commonly used bug commands are printed
on the standard output.

If the option '--all' or '-a' is given, then all available commands are
printed on the standard output.

If a bug command is named, a manual page for that command is brought
up. The 'man' program is used by default for this purpose, but this
can be overridden by other options or configuration variables.

Note that `bug --help ...` is identical to `bug help ...` because the
former is internally converted into the latter.

OPTIONS
-------
-a::
--all::
	Prints all the available commands on the standard output. This
	option supersedes any other option.
